# AI Model with Three Neural Networks

This repository contains a Keras implementation of an AI model with three neural networks. Each network comprises a stack of Dense layers with Dropout and BatchNormalization applied.

## Overview

The model consists of three neural networks that are structured as follows:

1. The first network includes an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. Regularization techniques such as Dropout and BatchNormalization are applied to prevent overfitting and accelerate training.

2. The second network is similar to the first one. It is connected to the first network and includes the same layers and regularization techniques.

3. The third network is the same as the other two and is connected to the second one. Its final layer has a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

## Setup and Requirements

This code is written in Python and requires the following packages:

- Keras
- TensorFlow
- numpy
- scikit-learn

Install these packages using pip:


## Usage

To train the model, you can run the script `train.py`:


## Issues and Future Improvements

The current version of the model is quite basic and there are several areas for potential improvement:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This implementation assumes that the input data has already been preprocessed. However, real-world data usually requires cleaning, normalization, and encoding steps before it can be used to train a model. See [Issue #1](link_to_issue_1).

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The hyperparameters in this model (like the learning rate, batch size, and network architecture) have been set to arbitrary values. They should be tuned to optimize model performance. See [Issue #2](link_to_issue_2).

3. **Model Evaluation**: Currently, the model's performance is evaluated on a held-out test set. More comprehensive evaluation methods, such as cross-validation, could be used. See [Issue #3](link_to_issue_3).

4. **Model Deployment**: There is currently no mechanism for saving and reloading the trained model for future use or deployment. See [Issue #4](link_to_issue_4).

5. **Real-time Inference**: This model could be adapted to perform real-time predictions on new data, depending on the use case. See [Issue #5](link_to_issue_5).
